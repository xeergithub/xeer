For over 1300 years, in the heart of the horn of Africa, determinations of right and wrong have been made without need of a formal, centralized legal system.  Instead, when one individual has a grievance with another, a tribunal is formed, consisting of wise people from both individualsâ€™ communities who listen to what has happened and decide how to resolve the matter.
 
The tribunal does not apply laws that have been dictated by any central authority or legislature.  No such authority exists.  Instead, the members of the group discover and use whatever principles may surface as they seek to determine the fair outcome of the applicable dispute.
 
Under the Xeer (pronounced like "hair") system in Somalia, fairness is determined by the people themselves, through applying doctrine they agree should govern conduct within their community.  When a dispute arises, community elders simply commence a tribunal by placing a mat under the shade of a tree to delineate the area of their authority, listen to whoever may have something to say on the matter and resolve the dispute based on the consensus of the group.
 
That is what Xeer.com is all about.
 
Xeer.com (we pronounce it like "zair") is designed to deliver fairness to people worldwide.
